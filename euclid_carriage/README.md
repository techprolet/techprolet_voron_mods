# Euclid Carriage

This is the right carriage from the official voron 2.4 repo with a Euclid probe mount built-in. This allows for 
- less weight (two less screws and a little bit less plastic) and, most importantly,
- better air flow: The side vents are not blocked, as in most Euclid mounts. 
  
  Airflow should be slightly better than the [euclid probe: slim mount](https://github.com/v6cl/MyDIYthings/tree/main/3Dprinters/VoronDesignMOD/euclid_mount_slim), from which the mount part was taken.
