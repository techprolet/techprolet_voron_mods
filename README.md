# techprolet voron mods

You'll find here my voron mods, for which I've used existing STLs (that is: others' STLs) as the basis for my models. Credits go to the original designers, of course, and the rest is published here under the GPL3 license.

I'll be submitting my 100% original voron mods to [VoronUsers](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers), so you may have a look there for the really good stuff.
